    <What>
      <p>
        Maintaining up-to-date architecture documentation is a challenge that plagues many development teams. In this guide, 
        I'll show you how to leverage <ContentHighlight>GitHub Copilot</ContentHighlight> to automatically generate and 
        maintain beautiful <ContentHighlight>architecture diagrams</ContentHighlight> using Mermaid syntax. This approach 
        eliminates manual diagramming work while ensuring your architecture documentation stays accurate as your codebase evolves.
      </p>
    </What>

    <Why>
      <p>
        Architecture diagrams are essential for understanding complex systems, onboarding new team members, and making 
        informed design decisions. Yet they often become outdated almost as soon as they're created, as code changes but 
        diagrams don't. This disconnect leads to confusion, misaligned development efforts, and wasted time.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using <ContentHighlight>GitHub Copilot</ContentHighlight> to analyze your codebase and generate 
        <ContentHighlight>Mermaid diagrams</ContentHighlight>, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure documentation accurately reflects your current architecture</li>
        <li>Automatically update diagrams when the codebase structure changes</li>
        <li>Save hours of manual diagramming work</li>
        <li>Standardize architectural representation across your organization</li>
        <li>Facilitate better communication between development teams and stakeholders</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This approach transforms architecture documentation from a tedious maintenance burden into a dynamic, up-to-date 
        resource that genuinely adds value to your development process.
      </p>
    </Why>

    <How>
      <h4>Setting Up Your Architecture Documentation Process</h4>
      
      <p>
        Let's set up a system for maintaining architecture documentation using GitHub Copilot. The key to success is 
        creating a well-structured prompt that guides Copilot to analyze your codebase and generate accurate diagrams.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 1: Create an Architecture Documentation Prompt</h4>
      
      <p>
        First, create a specialized prompt file to guide GitHub Copilot. Save this as a markdown file in your project 
        (e.g., <ContentHighlight>architecture-documentation-prompt.md</ContentHighlight>):
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
# Architecture Documentation & Maintenance Prompt for ILoveDotNet

As an expert software architect and documentation specialist familiar with .NET applications, assist me with 
analyzing and documenting my ILoveDotNet codebase architecture using the following approaches:

## PERSONA
You are a skilled software architect with deep knowledge of .NET ecosystems who can visualize complex systems 
and maintain technical documentation. You understand Blazor WASM, MAUI, and component-based architectures.

## INSTRUCTIONS
Analyze my ILoveDotNet codebase to create visual representations of the architecture and help maintain 
documentation that reflects the current state of the project.

## Task 1: Building Architecture Diagrams from Code

Please perform the following tasks in sequence:

1. **Analyze Application Structure**
   - Examine the entire ILoveDotNet.sln structure including all projects
   - Focus on both Web (Blazor WASM) and MAUI projects as the main entry points
   - Analyze how component libraries are organized and referenced
   - Identify key services and their dependencies
   - Understand the lazy loading mechanism for Blazor components
   - Document how the application handles cross-platform deployment

2. **Create Visual Representation**
   - Show the structure visually using Mermaid syntax
   - Create these three specific diagrams:
     1. Project structure diagram - showing how projects relate to each other
     2. Component interaction diagram - showing the runtime flow including lazy loading
     3. Deployment architecture diagram - showing how the app is built and deployed
   - Ensure all diagrams use valid Mermaid syntax with appropriate styling
   - Show clear relationships between components with proper node labels

3. **Document Architecture Visually**
   - Create a new file or update existing file at `docs/Architecture.md`
   - Include all Mermaid diagrams from step 2
   - Add explanatory text between diagrams
   - Include sections for Key Architectural Characteristics, Component Types, and Technical Implementation

4. **Track Architectural Changes**
   - Use git commands to identify recent structural changes in the codebase
   - Check for new projects, removed projects, or changes to project relationships
   - Update all affected diagrams to accurately reflect the current state
   - Preserve diagram styling and formatting
   - Note any significant architectural shifts or patterns introduced

## Task 2: Maintaining Documentation

Please help maintain project documentation with these specific tasks:

1. **Analyze Recent Commits**
   - Find all Git commits since tag vX.X.X for the current repo
   - Provide a categorized summary of changes (features, fixes, refactoring, etc.)

2. **Deep Code Change Analysis**
   - Discover all code changes for all commits since vX.X.X
   - Provide a categorized summary based on actual code changes, not just commit messages
   - Highlight architectural changes, new patterns introduced, and significant refactorings

3. **Generate Release Notes**
   - Use all commits since vX.X.X
   - Follow the release note template in RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md
   - Generate a draft release_notes.md file

4. **Version Management**
   - Commit the release notes with an appropriate tag of vX.X.X
   - Ensure the version is correctly incremented according to semantic versioning

## FORMAT
Provide results in markdown format with appropriate sections, code blocks, and Mermaid diagrams where applicable.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        This prompt creates a persona for GitHub Copilot to follow, with specific instructions for analyzing your codebase and 
        generating architecture diagrams. It focuses on three key diagram types: project structure, component interaction, 
        and deployment architecture.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2: Initial Architecture Documentation Generation</h4>
      
      <p>
        With your prompt file ready, you can now use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate your initial architecture documentation:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open GitHub Copilot Chat in your editor (typically with <ContentHighlight>Ctrl+Shift+I</ContentHighlight> or click the Copilot icon)</li>
        <li>Send a prompt like this, referencing your detailed prompt file:</li>
      </ol>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
Please analyze my codebase following the instructions in architecture-documentation-prompt.md and create an 
architecture documentation file with Mermaid diagrams showing the project structure, component interactions, and deployment process.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        GitHub Copilot will examine your code structure, analyze dependencies, and generate the architecture documentation 
        with appropriate Mermaid diagrams. The output might look something like this:
      </p>

application architecture using Mermaid diagrams.

## Project Structure

The following diagram illustrates the high-level project structure and 
relationships between the main components:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Entry Points"
        Web["Web Project<br>(Blazor WASM)"]
        MAUI["MAUI Project<br>(Cross-platform native app)"]
    end

    subgraph "Core Components"
        BaseComponents["BaseComponents<br>(Core UI elements)"]
        CommonComponents["CommonComponents<br>(Shared UI elements)"]
        SharedComponents["SharedComponents<br>(Utility components)"]
        SharedModels["SharedModels<br>(Data models)"]
    end

    subgraph "Demo Components" 
        AIDemoComponents["AIDemoComponents"]
        BlazorDemo["BlazorDemoComponents"]
        LINQDemo["LINQDemoComponents"]
        DIDemoComponents["DependencyInjectionDemoComponents"]
        DesignPatternDemo["DesignPatternDemoComponents"]
        OOPSDemo["OOPSDemoComponents"]
        RegexDemo["RegexDemoComponents"]

      </CodeSnippet>

      <h4>Step 3: Maintaining and Updating Architecture Documentation</h4>

      <p>
        As your project evolves, you'll need to keep your architecture documentation up-to-date. GitHub Copilot 
        makes this easy:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
Look at the last Git commit I did to see what changed structurally in the codebase. Update my Mermaid 
architecture diagram accordingly.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        Copilot will analyze recent changes and update the diagrams to reflect the current state of your codebase. 
        For example, when I asked Copilot to update our architecture diagram after recent changes, it identified 
        a new AI component and updated the diagram:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-diff">
graph TB
    subgraph "Entry Points"
        Web["Web Project<br>(Blazor WASM)"]
        MAUI["MAUI Project<br>(Cross-platform native app)"]
    end

    subgraph "Core Components"
        BaseComponents["BaseComponents<br>(Core UI elements)"]
        CommonComponents["CommonComponents<br>(Shared UI elements)"]
        SharedComponents["SharedComponents<br>(Utility components)"]
        SharedModels["SharedModels<br>(Data models)"]
+       AIServices["AIServices<br>(AI Integration)"]
    end

    subgraph "Demo Components" 
        AIDemoComponents["AIDemoComponents"]
+       CopilotDemos["CopilotDemoComponents"]
        BlazorDemo["BlazorDemoComponents"]
        // ...other demo components...
    end
      </CodeSnippet>

      <h4>Step 4: Setting Up Automated Documentation Updates</h4>

      <p>
        For an even more streamlined approach, you can automate architecture documentation updates using GitHub Actions:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-yaml">
name: Update Architecture Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - '**/*.csproj'
      - '**/*.sln'
      - 'docs/Architecture.md'

jobs:
  update-architecture:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      
      - name: Install GitHub Copilot CLI
        run: npm install -g @@github/copilot-cli
      
      - name: Update architecture documentation
        run: |
          echo "Analyzing code architecture changes..."
          github-copilot-cli architecture-update
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Commit changes if needed
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add docs/Architecture.md
          if git diff --staged --quiet; then
            echo "No changes to commit"
          else
            git commit -m "📝 Update architecture documentation"
            git push
          fi
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        This workflow automatically triggers when project files change, using GitHub Copilot CLI to update 
        the architecture documentation.
      </p>

      <h4>Customizing Diagram Styles</h4>

      <p>
        You can enhance your Mermaid diagrams with customized styling for better readability:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
Please update my architecture diagram with the following style enhancements:
1. Use color coding for different component types (core, demo, utilities)
2. Add clearer relationship labels
3. Improve the layout for better readability
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        Copilot will then apply professional styling to your diagrams:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
%% Layout control

      OWASPDemo,SignalRDemo,SOLIDDemo,TDDDemo,TestingDemo,
      PythonDemo,TalkDemo demoComponent
      </CodeSnippet>

      <h4>Documenting Architectural Decisions</h4>

      <p>
        In addition to diagrams, you can ask Copilot to document key architectural decisions:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
Based on the codebase analysis, document the key architectural characteristics and decisions that 
shaped this project.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        Copilot will generate explanatory content about your architecture:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
## Key Architectural Characteristics

1. **Modular Design**: The application is structured into multiple component
   libraries, each focusing on a specific aspect of .NET technology.

2. **Dual Entry Points**: 
   - **Web Project (Blazor WASM)**: For browser-based access
   - **MAUI Project**: For native application access across multiple platforms 
     (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows)
   - **MAUI as a Shell**: The MAUI project uses BlazorWebView to render the 
     same Blazor WASM components as the Web project but inside a native 
     application shell, providing access to native platform features while 
     maintaining a unified codebase

3. **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on-demand to optimize initial load 
   time and performance.

4. **Shared Component Model**: Both entry points share the same component 
   libraries, maximizing code reuse.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <h4>Analyzing Changes Between Versions</h4>

      <p>
        For projects with version tags, you can analyze architectural changes between releases:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
Find all architectural changes between v1.0.0 and v2.0.0 and generate a summary of how the system 
structure evolved.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        This helps maintain a record of how your architecture evolves over time.
      </p>

      <h4>Real-World Example: Updating ILoveDotNet Architecture</h4>

      <p>
        Let's look at a real example of how I used GitHub Copilot to update the ILoveDotNet architecture documentation. 
        I recently added a new AI learning path to the project, which included new components for GitHub Copilot integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked Copilot to update our architecture diagram:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">
Analyze the recent addition of the AI learning path and Copilot components to the ILoveDotNet codebase. 
Update the architecture diagrams in docs/Architecture.md to reflect these changes while maintaining the existing formatting and style.
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        Copilot analyzed the changes and updated the diagrams, adding new nodes for the AI components and updating the 
        relationships. Here's an excerpt of what changed:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-diff">
subgraph "Demo Components" 
+       AIDemoComponents["AIDemoComponents"]
        BlazorDemo["BlazorDemoComponents"]
        LINQDemo["LINQDemoComponents"]
        // ...other components...
    end

    %% Component dependencies
    BaseComponents --> SharedModels
    SharedComponents --> SharedModels
    CommonComponents --> BaseComponents
    CommonComponents --> SharedComponents
    
    %% Entry point dependencies
    Web --> CommonComponents
    Web --> SharedComponents
    Web --> SharedModels
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        Copilot also updated the deployment diagram to reflect how the new AI components are integrated:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-diff">
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Development"
        Dev["Developer Workstation"]

        BuildMAUI["Build MAUI Apps"]
        Tests["Run Tests"]
        // ...other elements...
    end
      </CodeSnippet>

      <p>
        The result is always a professionally updated architecture document that accurately reflects the current 
        state of the codebase, with minimal manual effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final architecture documentation will look like this:
      </p>

      <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-markdown">

## Key Architectural Characteristics

1. **Modular Design**: The application is structured into multiple component libraries, each focusing on a specific aspect of .NET technology.

2. **Dual Entry Points**: 
   - **Web Project (Blazor WASM)**: For browser-based access
   - **MAUI Project**: For native application access across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows)
   - **MAUI as a Shell**: The MAUI project uses BlazorWebView to render the same Blazor WASM components as the Web project but inside a native application shell, providing access to native platform features while maintaining a unified codebase

3. **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on-demand to optimize initial load time and performance.

4. **Shared Component Model**: Both entry points share the same component libraries, maximizing code reuse.

5. **JavaScript Interoperability**: Uses JSInterop for browser-native functionality when needed.

6. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and platforms.

7. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated build and deployment through GitHub Actions.

8. **Testing**: Includes UI testing capabilities for ensuring quality.

## Component Types

1. **Core Components**: Basic building blocks used across the application
   - BaseComponents
   - CommonComponents
   - SharedComponents
   - SharedModels

2. **Demo Components**: Topic-specific components that demonstrate various .NET technologies
   - BlazorDemoComponents
   - LINQDemoComponents
   - DependencyInjectionDemoComponents
   - Many others (20+ topic areas)

3. **Utilities**: Supporting tools and services
   - RSSFeedGenerator
   - SitemapGenerator
   - UITests
   - EndToEndTests (Playwright)

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: C# with Razor components
- **Framework**: .NET 10.0 with Blazor WebAssembly and .NET MAUI
- **Styling**: CSS with custom classes
- **JavaScript Integration**: Module-based JS isolation
- **Testing**: XUnit with coverage reporting
- **MAUI Implementation**: Uses BlazorWebView to host the same web components as the Web project inside a native shell, providing a unified experience with native platform capabilities

## Maintenance and Evolution

This architecture documentation is maintained with the help of GitHub Copilot. As the codebase evolves, the diagrams and explanations are updated using AI-assisted analysis of code changes. This approach ensures that the documentation remains accurate and up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

Key benefits of this approach include:
- Automatic detection of structural changes in the codebase
- Consistent diagram styling and formatting
- Accurate representation of project relationships
- Documentation that evolves alongside the code

    <Summary>
      <p>
        Using GitHub Copilot for architecture diagram generation transforms documentation from a tedious chore into 
        an automated, accurate, and valuable part of your development process. By creating a well-structured prompt 
        and incorporating it into your workflow, you can ensure your architecture diagrams always reflect the 
        current state of your codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach offers significant benefits: consistently up-to-date documentation, standardized visual 
        representation, time savings, and improved communication across your team. As your project evolves, 
        your architecture diagrams evolve with it, maintaining their value as a reference point for both new 
        and existing team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        For large, complex projects like ILoveDotNet with multiple interrelated components, maintaining accurate 
        documentation manually would be nearly impossible. With GitHub Copilot, it becomes not just possible, 
        but straightforward. Start implementing this approach in your projects today, and watch as your 
        architecture documentation transforms from a burden into an asset.
