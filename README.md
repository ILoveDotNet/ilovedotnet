# Please share with the community
As an open-source project without funding, I cannot afford advertising I ‚ù§Ô∏è .NET in a typical way. Instead, the project relies on community interactions. Please consider sharing a post about I ‚ù§Ô∏è .NET and the value it provides. It really does help!

# Test Coverage 

To see test coverage for tests you've written, you can use the default [**coverlet**](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) tool that is included with the `XUnit` test project template.

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Then use the [**reportgenerator**](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) global tool to generate an HTML report.  To install the tool
(you only need to do this once):

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

Then run the following command to generate the report:

```bash
reportgenerator -reports:".\UITests\TestResults\**\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverage" -reporttypes:Html
```
To remove any contents from previous runs, use the following PowerShell command:

```bash
gci -include TestResults,coverage -recurse | remove-item -force -recurse
```
