# Please share with the community
As an open-source project without funding, I cannot afford advertising I ❤️ .NET in a typical way. Instead, the project relies on community interactions. Please consider sharing a post about I ❤️ .NET and the value it provides. It really does help!

# Star History (THANK YOU SO MUCH ❤️)

# Test Coverage 

To see test coverage for tests you've written, you can use the default [**coverlet**](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) tool that is included with the `XUnit` test project template.

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Then use the [**reportgenerator**](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) global tool to generate an HTML report.  To install the tool
(you only need to do this once):

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

Then run the following command to generate the report:

```bash
reportgenerator -reports:".\UITests\TestResults\**\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverage" -reporttypes:Html
```
To remove any contents from previous runs, use the following PowerShell command:

```bash
gci -include TestResults,coverage -recurse | remove-item -force -recurse
```

# CI/CD Pipeline

Our continuous integration and deployment pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the ILoveDotNet application. 
The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and is defined in `.github/workflows/build-blazor-app.yml`.

## Workflow Triggers

The CI/CD pipeline can be triggered in several ways:
- **Push to main**: Automatically runs when changes are pushed to the main branch (excluding markdown files)
- **Pull Requests**: Runs on pull requests targeting the main branch
- **Weekly Schedule**: Runs every Sunday at 17:00 UTC to ensure dependencies are up-to-date
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be manually triggered through the GitHub Actions interface

## Pipeline Visualization

The following diagram illustrates the complete CI/CD workflow:

## Workflow Structure

The ILoveDotNet CI/CD pipeline uses a single comprehensive job that handles all aspects of the build, test, and deployment process. This design choice provides several advantages:

1. **Simplified Dependency Management**: All steps share the same environment and workspace
2. **Sequential Execution Control**: Each phase (setup, build, test, deploy) runs in a controlled order
3. **Consolidated Logging**: All related logs appear in a single job context for easier troubleshooting
4. **Resource Efficiency**: No duplicate checkout or setup steps required across multiple jobs

The workflow includes conditional deployment logic to ensure GitHub Pages is only updated when appropriate conditions are met:
- Deployments only occur on pushes to the main branch (not pull requests)
- Deployments are skipped for automated dependency updates from Dependabot
