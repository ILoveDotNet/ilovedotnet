    <p>
      Career skills are the skills that are necessary to succeed in a particular job or profession. These skills can include technical skills, such as proficiency in a specific programming language or software application, as well as soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to these skills, it is important to continuously update your knowledge and stay current with industry trends to remain competitive in the job market.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll share some of the practices that I have learned over the years that have helped me in my career. These practices are not exhaustive, but they can serve as a starting point for anyone looking to improve their skills and advance their career.
    </p>

    <p>
      One important practice is to seek feedback regularly. Constructive criticism can provide valuable insights into your strengths and areas for improvement, helping you to grow professionally.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep your linkedin profile updated. This is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers. Make sure to include relevant keywords in your profile to increase your visibility in search results.
    </p>

    <p>
        Always keep your resume updated. Your resume is your first impression to potential employers, so make sure it is polished and up-to-date. 
        Tailor your resume to each job application, highlighting the skills and experience that are most relevant to the position.
        For example, I used to have my resume in a git repo in a HTML format. I'll keep on updating it with the latest skills and experience.
        This way, I can easily host in github pages and generate a PDF version of it and share it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The key competencies to focus on include:
