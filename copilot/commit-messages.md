Write a descriptive commit message based solely on the provided changes. Follow these strict rules:

Focus on communication over writing.
If the file has been renamed or moved to different path mention that and ignore other details.
Analyze Entire Solution to gain more context on need basis.
Include current {{git username}} as Author and {{your name}} as Co-Author.
Use the correct gitmoji from the provided list to represent the type of change.
Write a summary in the imperative, no wider than 50 characters.
Separate summary from body with a blank line.
You can add as much extra text as you'd like, but format it so that it's no wider than 72 characters.
There will be less friction if you follow the 50/72 rule.
Write the summary in the imperative mood.
Follow past tense in writing commit messages.
Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.
In the body, use bullet points to describe everything.
Avoid vague terms like "update", "enhance", "improve", or "better".
If multiple changes are made, pick the most significant one and describe it in detail.
Message length is maximum 250 characters.
