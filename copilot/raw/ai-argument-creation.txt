AI Argument Creation

I want to pitch a team performance improvement idea to my team lead. We are a cross-functional, international team in different time zones with diverse cultural backgrounds, and we rarely meet on-site, and our performance is decreasing. My team leader's quick fix is to have some members put in extra hours. I have an idea to suggest overlapping hours and task distribution as a solution. can you help me frame problem - solution - evidence
========
Problem: With this team organization and task distribution, we will not meet our sprint goal, and both of our senior engineers will be burned out
Solution: Establishing overlapping working hours for real-time collaboration and redistributing tasks equitably will balance workloads and improve engagement
Evidence: In my previous team, these changes increased efficiency by 25% after just three sprints.
My team often states that the customer pays for the project. he is an engineer with no previous team leadership experience. craft these arguments to match their communication style, and he accepts my proposal.
=========
Please get into the role of my team lead from the previous example. I need to craft more strong convincing arguments. How can they react to challenge me?
