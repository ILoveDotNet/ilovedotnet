Claude Sonnet works well.

1. Building Diagrams from Code:

Describe the main components and general architecture of this dotnet application.

Now show me the same structure visually using Mermaid syntax.

Create a new file to document the application's architecture visually using Mermaid syntax.

Run the prompt in Agent Mode:

Look at the last Git commit I did to see what changed structurally in the codebase. Update my Mermaid architectufe diagram accordingly.

2. Maintaining Documentation:

Run the prompt in Agent Mode:

Find all Git commits since tag vX.X.X for the current repo and provide a categorized summay.

Discover all of the code changes for all commits since v2.0.0 and provide a categorized summary; don't just look at commit messages.

Use all commits since vX.X.X, follow our release note template in RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md, and generate a draft release_notes.md.

Commit the release notes with a tag of vX.X.X.
