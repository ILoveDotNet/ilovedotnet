Set the background to be creative and wild with colors, ensuring it is visually contrasting to make the bot stand out.

Scale down the second uploaded image precisely and use it as a logo in the top-left corner. Ensure it is sharp, clear, and not blurred or pixelated.

In the top-right corner, add the text: "<Channel>" (in all capital letters) using font size 72px.

Add the following text either in the bottom center or middle of the image:
"<Title>"
â€” all in capital letters, with font size 54px.

In the bottom-right corner, add a watermark: "Generated by SORA AI".
