Your audience consists of .NET developers ranging from intermediate to advanced level who are looking for practical solutions and deeper understanding of .NET concepts. They value:
- Clear explanations without oversimplification
- Code examples they can adapt to their own projects
- Insights into best practices and potential pitfalls
- Content that respects their time by being concise yet complete

## Before You Start

STOP! Before writing a single line of code or explanation, ask yourself:
1. **What's the exact topic** I'm covering? (Be specific)
2. **What are 2-3 key points** readers must understand?
3. **What code examples** will best illustrate the concept?
4. **What common misconceptions** exist around this topic?
5. **Why should .NET developers care** about this right now?

Make sure you thoroughly research the topic and understand all technical aspects before proceeding.

## Voice & Style Guidelines

- **Short, punchy sentences** that maintain reader momentum
- **Speak to smart, curious, busy developers** who need clear solutions
- **Create dramatic pacing with breaks** between complex concepts
- **Use bold analogies and clever metaphors** to explain abstract concepts
- **Mix in light humor** where appropriate (but keep it professional)
- **Use transitions** like "Here's the thing," "Now," or "That's why…" 
- **Include 1-2 rhetorical questions** to engage the reader
- **Address the reader directly** using "you" to create connection
- **Break complex topics** into digestible chunks
- **Show, don't just tell** - demonstrate with code, not just explanations

## Content Process

1. **Start with Compelling Titles and Hooks**
   - Brainstorm multiple attention-grabbing title ideas
   - Focus on the most valuable or surprising aspects of the topic
   - Craft an opening hook that immediately draws readers in
   - Make your introduction scroll-stopping and value-focused

2. **Structure Your Content Journey**
   - Build your article using this sequence:
     - **Hook**: Start with a bold statement or surprising insight
     - **Main Idea**: Introduce the concept and why it matters
     - **Supporting Evidence**: Provide clear examples and benefits
     - **Real-World Application**: Show how it fits into development workflows
     - **Conclusion & Takeaways**: Summarize key points and offer forward-looking insights

3. **Technical Specifications**
   - Aim for concise explanations - be thorough but respect reader's time
   - Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences maximum)
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists for better readability
   - Include high-quality code snippets that can be copied and used directly

## Content Strategy

- **Prioritize practicality over theory** - developers want solutions
- **Focus on real-world applications** that can be implemented immediately
- **Use frameworks to structure explanations**:
  - "Problem → Solution → Result"
  - "Old Way → New Way → Why it matters"
- **Highlight what's new, underrated, or commonly misunderstood**
- **When relevant, use a personal lens**: "I've implemented this in production by..." or "In my experience..."

## Basic Structure

All blog posts with `UseNewTableOfContentsMenu=true` should follow this structure:

```razor
@page "/blogs/{slug-for-the-article}"
@inherits BasePage

<Content FileName=@nameof(ActualFileName) UseNewTableOfContentsMenu=true>
  <ContentBody>
    <What>
      <p>
        <!-- Introduction content here -->
      </p>
    </What>

    <Why>
      <p>
        <!-- Importance/relevance content here -->
      </p>
    </Why>

    <How>
      <p>
        <!-- Implementation details, steps, code samples, images, etc. -->
      </p>
    </How>

    <Summary>
      <p>
        <!-- Conclusion and key takeaways -->
      </p>
    </Summary>
  </ContentBody>
</Content>
```

## Section Requirements

Each blog post must include these four sections in this specific order:

### 1. What Section

- Introduces the topic and sets expectations
- Should be concise but informative
- Highlight key terms with `<ContentHighlight>` tags
- Start with a hook to grab attention (bold statement, question, scenario, or analogy)
- If needed, use `<h4>` tags for subheadings within this section
- Example:
  ```html
  <What>
    <p>
      Building an API without proper error handling is like constructing a house without a roof. In this article, let's learn about <ContentHighlight>Global Exception Handling</ContentHighlight> in <ContentHighlight>Web API</ContentHighlight> in ASP.NET Core - the safety net every API deserves.
    </p>
  </What>
  ```

### 2. Why Section

- Explains the importance and relevance of the topic
- Should include benefits, use cases, or problems being solved
- May contain multiple paragraphs for complex topics
- Frame content in terms of problem → solution → result when possible
- Highlight what's new, underrated, or commonly misunderstood
- For complex "Why" sections, use `<h4>` tags to organize subsections
- Example:
  ```html
  <Why>
    <p>
      <ContentHighlight>Global Exception Handling</ContentHighlight> allows us to handle exceptions globally
      in <ContentHighlight>one single place</ContentHighlight> inside the application rather than scattering
      try-catch blocks everywhere in the code base. This is a <ContentHighlight>good and clean practice
      </ContentHighlight> that simplifies code maintenance and improves readability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it as a safety net that catches all errors, no matter where they occur in your application. Without this approach, you'd need to add error handling to every endpoint - a tedious and error-prone process.
    </p>
  </Why>
  ```

### 3. How Section

- Provides implementation details, usually as steps
- Often contains code snippets, examples, and explanations
- May include images where helpful
- **Always use `<h4>` tags for subheadings within content sections** - this is important for readability and for the auto-generated table of contents
- Avoid using numbered lists (`<ol>`) for step-by-step instructions - use `<h4>` headings for steps instead
- Example:
  ```html
  <How>
    <p>
      To implement Global Exception Handling, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <h4>Step 1: Configure Middleware</h4>
    <p>First, let's set up our exception handling middleware:</p>
    <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-csharp">
      // Code example...
    </CodeSnippet>
    
    <h4>Step 2: Create Error Response Model</h4>
    <p>Next, create a standardized error response:</p>
    <CodeSnippet CssClass="language-csharp">
      // Code example...
    </CodeSnippet>
    <!-- Additional steps -->
  </How>
  ```

### 4. Summary Section

- Concludes the article with key takeaways
- Should be concise but reinforce the main points
- For longer summaries, consider using `<h4>` tags to organize content by categories (e.g., "Benefits", "Next Steps")
- Example:
  ```html
  <Summary>
    <p>
      In this article, we explored the <ContentHighlight>simplest and easiest</ContentHighlight> way to handle
      exceptions globally in ASP.NET Web API using a <ContentHighlight>custom middleware</ContentHighlight>.
      This approach centralizes exception handling, reduces code duplication, and improves maintainability.
    </p>
  </Summary>
  ```

## Formatting Guidelines

### Code Snippets

Use the `<CodeSnippet>` component for all code blocks:

```html
<CodeSnippet CssClass="language-csharp">
// C# code here
// Remember to escape < as &lt; and > as &gt;
var service = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService&lt;IMyService&gt;();
</CodeSnippet>
```

- Always specify the correct language for proper syntax highlighting using the `CssClass` attribute
- Common language options:
  - `language-csharp` for C# code
  - `language-html` for HTML
  - `language-css` for CSS
  - `language-javascript` or `language-js` for JavaScript
  - `language-razor` for Razor files
- Ensure to escape `@` with `@@` and `<` with `&lt;` and `>` with `&gt;` in code samples

### Key Term Highlighting

Use `<ContentHighlight>` to emphasize important terms, concepts, or code references within text:

```html
<ContentHighlight>key concept</ContentHighlight>
```

### GitHub Gist Integration

If you encounter a GitHub Gist snippet:

```html
<GithubGistSnippet Title="Code Title" UserId="user-id" FileName="filename"></GithubGistSnippet>
```

Retrieve the content from `https://gist.github.com/{UserId}/{FileName}` and display it appropriately.

## Table of Contents

When `UseNewTableOfContentsMenu=true` is used, the Content component automatically generates a table of contents with links to each section:

```html
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <NavLink href="blogs/{slug}#what" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
      What we gonna do?
    </NavLink>
  </li>
  <li>
    <NavLink href="blogs/{slug}#why" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
      Why we gonna do?
    </NavLink>
  </li>
  <li>
    <NavLink href="blogs/{slug}#how" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
      How we gonna do?
    </NavLink>
  </li>
  <li>
    <NavLink href="blogs/{slug}#summary" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
      Summary
    </NavLink>
  </li>
</ol>
```

## General Content Principles

1. **Clarity & Simplicity**: Keep content simple, easy to read, and understand. Use short, punchy sentences.
2. **Engagement**: Write in a conversational but smart tone — explain concepts like you would to a sharp colleague.
3. **Completeness**: Cover the topic thoroughly without unnecessary tangents.
4. **Accuracy**: Ensure all technical information is correct and up-to-date.
5. **Organization**: Follow the What-Why-How-Summary structure consistently.
6. **Highlighting**: Use `<ContentHighlight>` for important terms and concepts.
7. **Code Samples**: Always wrap code in appropriate `<CodeSnippet>` tags with proper language specification.
8. **Pacing**: Break up complex concepts with short paragraphs and use transitional phrases like "Here's the thing," "Now," or "That's why…"
9. **Reader Focus**: Address the reader directly when appropriate ("you").
10. **Analogies & Examples**: Use relatable analogies and practical examples to make complex concepts more digestible.

## Effective Hooks and Introductions

Your "What" section should grab attention immediately. Consider:
- Opening with a bold statement or surprising insight
- Using a rhetorical question that addresses a common pain point
- Starting with a concrete scenario that developers can relate to
- Highlighting a common mistake or misconception

Example:
```html
<What>
  <p>
    Building an API without proper error handling is like constructing a house without a roof. In this article, let's learn about <ContentHighlight>Global Exception Handling</ContentHighlight> in <ContentHighlight>Web API</ContentHighlight> in ASP.NET Core - the safety net every API deserves.
  </p>
</What>
```

Each article should have 3-5 engaging hook approaches you could use, such as:

1. **Problem-based**: "Ever deployed code only to have it break catastrophically in production? Here's how global exception handling prevents those 2AM emergency calls."

2. **Curiosity gap**: "There's a single pattern that could save you hundreds of lines of code when building ASP.NET APIs. Let's explore global exception handling."

3. **Surprising statistic**: "Studies show that 70% of API stability issues stem from improper exception handling. Here's how to be in the successful 30%."

4. **Before/After scenario**: "Before: scattered try/catch blocks everywhere. After: centralized, consistent error handling. Let's make the switch."

5. **Direct challenge**: "If your API returns raw exceptions to clients, you're doing it wrong. Let's fix that with global exception handling."

## Technical Specifications

- **Article Length**: Aim for 1000-1500 words total, with each section proportionally balanced
- **Paragraph Structure**: Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences maximum) to improve readability
- **Code Samples**: Include 2-3 high-quality, focused code examples that demonstrate the concept
- **Headers and Subheaders**: Use clear, descriptive headers for each major section
- **Citations**: Reference official documentation or authoritative sources where appropriate
- **Formatting**: Use bold, italics, and highlighting strategically to emphasize key points

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The slug for the article is automatically generated from the file path or route
- Each section should have at least one paragraph of content
- The Content component handles the generation of the table of contents automatically
- When specifying the file name in the Content component, use `@nameof(ActualFileName)` to ensure consistency
- Ensure proper escaping of HTML special characters in code snippets
- **Blog Placement**: Each blog should be placed in the appropriate category project:
  - Create the blog inside the `{{Category}}DemoComponents.csproj` project
  - Place the blog in a folder named after the slug in the page title
  - The Razor file should be placed inside this folder (e.g., `AIDemoComponents/using-github-copilot-ai-for-commit-message-generation/CommitMessage.razor`)
  - Additional files like images or resources should be stored in the `wwwroot/image/blogs/{{category}}/{{slug}}`. (e.g., `AIDemoComponents/wwwroot/image/blogs/ai/using-github-copilot-ai-for-commit-message-generation/image-name.png`)

By following these guidelines, you'll create valuable, consistent content that helps .NET developers learn and apply new concepts effectively.
