This can cause problems if you want to work with people on other platforms.

To be portable it is advisable to rename the file.

If you know what you are doing you can disable this check using:

  git config hooks.allownonascii true
EOF
	exit 1

# - `git diff --cached --name-only`: Lists the staged files.
# - `--diff-filter=ACM`: Filters only Added (A), Copied (C), or Modified (M) files.
# - `"*.cs"`: Restricts the list to C# files.
# - `sed 's| |\\ |g'`: Escapes spaces in file paths for proper handling.

# Add back the modified files to staging
echo "$FILES" | xargs git add
