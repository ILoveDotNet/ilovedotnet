        <What>
            <p>
                Performance testing helps you understand how your application behaves under heavy load, such as when
                <ContentHighlight>10, 100, or 10,000 users</ContentHighlight> access it simultaneously. This involves
                using <ContentHighlight>performance, load, and stress tests</ContentHighlight> to identify bottlenecks
                and ensure your application performs reliably. Focus on <ContentHighlight>high-usage features (hot
                    paths)</ContentHighlight>, as they are most likely to slow down under load. Begin with simple tests,
                particularly those targeting <ContentHighlight>shared resources like databases</ContentHighlight>, to
                establish a foundation for optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                When conducting these tests, avoid running them in <ContentHighlight>production environments
                </ContentHighlight> unless it's carefully planned, as they can strain resources and disrupt users.
                Leverage <ContentHighlight>metrics and telemetry</ContentHighlight> to identify performance issues and
                prioritize fixes. Keep in mind that addressing one bottleneck can shift the issue elsewhere, which is a
                natural part of performance testing. To perform these tests, use tools like <ContentHighlight>NBomber
                    for .NET</ContentHighlight>, which allows you to write tests in C#. For more advanced needs,
                consider <ContentHighlight>JMeter</ContentHighlight>, a standard load-testing framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's best to test <ContentHighlight>APIs</ContentHighlight> rather than UIs, as the backend typically
                contains <ContentHighlight>shared resources</ContentHighlight> that need optimization. Run your tests in
                <ContentHighlight>release mode</ContentHighlight> to obtain the most accurate results. Always compare
                the <ContentHighlight>performance of new code versions</ContentHighlight> against previous ones to
                identify potential regressions or improvements. These comparisons will help you refine your
                application's performance iteratively.
            </p>
        </What>

        <Why>
            <p>
                Performance testing revolves around answering key questions about your application's behavior. Monitor
                metrics like <ContentHighlight>throughput and response times</ContentHighlight> to ensure consistent
                performance after an initial <ContentHighlight>warm-up period</ContentHighlight>. Pay close attention to
                <ContentHighlight>memory usage</ContentHighlight>, as uncontrolled growth could indicate
                <ContentHighlight>leaks</ContentHighlight> that eventually lead to crashes. Stabilizing memory under
                load is critical to maintaining application reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key focus is identifying the <ContentHighlight>breaking point</ContentHighlight> of your
                application. Use varying <ContentHighlight>load levels and durations</ContentHighlight> to pinpoint when
                performance starts to degrade. This analysis helps determine whether <ContentHighlight>scaling
                </ContentHighlight>, such as adding API instances or increasing persistence layer resources, is
                necessary. If you've released a <ContentHighlight>new version</ContentHighlight> of your application,
                compare its performance to <ContentHighlight>previous versions</ContentHighlight>. Look for differences
                in <ContentHighlight>response times</ContentHighlight> or <ContentHighlight>throughput
                </ContentHighlight> and evaluate whether the changes are acceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Performance testing is an <ContentHighlight>iterative process</ContentHighlight>. Refine your
                <ContentHighlight>test code and parameters</ContentHighlight> based on the results to continuously
                improve. Analyzing <ContentHighlight>metrics</ContentHighlight> and acting on the data will help you
                ensure your application performs reliably under different load conditions.
            </p>
        </Why>

                        your main application code.
